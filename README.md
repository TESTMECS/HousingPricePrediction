# Ames, Iowa Housing Stacked Model. 

CS559, Stevens Institute of Technology

In this CS559 project, we aimed to predict 'SalePrice' in real estate using EDA, advanced feature engineering, and feature clustering. We integrated diverse models, rigorously tested with MSE, and harmonized through a stacking regressor. Result: precise predictions and a new standard for impactful data-driven decision-making in real estate.

We participated in a competition against other students in the class to see who could come up with the most accurate predictions. Our model landed us in the top 10 groups in the class leading to some extra points ðŸ˜Ž
