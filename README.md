# Ames, Iowa Housing Stacked Model. 

CS559, Stevens Institute of Technology

In this CS559 project, we aimed to predict 'SalePrice' in real estate using EDA, advanced feature engineering, and feature clustering. We integrated diverse models, rigorously tested with MSE, and harmonized through a stacking regressor. Result: precise predictions and a new standard for impactful data-driven decision-making in real estate.
